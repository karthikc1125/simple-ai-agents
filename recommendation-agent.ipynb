      "Based on your profile as a Student with Python skills and a hands-on learning style, here is your personalized roadmap to becoming an AI Developer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## RECOMMENDED CSE DOMAIN\n",
      "**Applied Machine Learning & AI Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "## REASONING\n",
      "*   **Skill Alignment:** You already know Python, which is the absolute standard language for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. You don't need to learn a new syntax, so you can jump straight into libraries and concepts.\n",
      "*   **Learning Style Fit:** AI is best learned by doing. While the math is important, modern libraries (like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow) allow you to build working models quickly. This aligns perfectly with your \"Hands-on Projects\" preference.\n",
      "*   **Time Management:** With 3 hours available daily, you have enough time to digest complex mathematical concepts (1 hour) and code/debug (2 hours) without burning out.\n",
      "*   **Career Trajectory:** \"AI Developer\" is a high-demand role that sits at the intersection of Software Engineering (building the app) and Data Science (training the model).\n",
      "\n",
      "## ESSENTIAL CS KNOWLEDGE TO LEARN\n",
      "To move from a Python coder to an AI Developer, you need to master these five pillars:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Basic understanding of lists, dictionaries, trees, and complexity (Big O notation) to write efficient code.\n",
      "2.  **Mathematics for ML:** specifically **Linear Algebra** (vectors, matrices) and **Statistics/Probability** (distributions, mean/median, standard deviation).\n",
      "3.  **Data Manipulation:** How to clean, sort, and process raw data (using libraries like Pandas and NumPy).\n",
      "4.  **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Understanding the logic behind Regression, Classification, and Clustering.\n",
      "5.  **Model Deployment:** How to wrap your AI model in an API (using Flask or FastAPI) so users can actually interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3-6 MONTH BEGINNER ROADMAP\n",
      "\n",
      "### Month 1-2: Foundation (Data Science Stack)\n",
      "*Goal: Become comfortable manipulating data and visualizing it.*\n",
      "-   **Task 1 (Week 1-3):** Master **NumPy** and **Pandas**. Learn to load CSV files, clean missing data, and filter rows/columns.\n",
      "-   **Task 2 (Week 4-6):** Learn Data Visualization with **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn**. You cannot model data you don't understand. Plot histograms and scatter plots to find patterns.\n",
      "-   **Task 3 (Math Integration):** Spend 30 minutes of your 3-hour block watching **StatQuest** videos (YouTube) to understand the math behind the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Month 2-3: Core Skills (Classical Machine Learning)\n",
      "*Goal: Build models that can predict numbers or classify objects.*\n",
      "-   **Task 1 (Week 1-4):** Learn **Scikit-Learn**. Implement Linear Regression (predicting values) and Logistic Regression (predicting yes/no).\n",
      "-   **Task 2 (Week 5-6):** Learn specific algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Understand \"Overfitting\" vs. \"Underfitting.\"\n",
      "-   **Task 3 (Evaluation):** Learn how to score your models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Month 4-6: Application & Projects (Deep Learning & APIs)\n",
      "*Goal: Intro to Neural Networks and building full applications.*\n",
      "-   **Project 1 (Deep Learning):** Introduction to **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**. Build a simple Neural Network.\n",
      "-   **Project 2 (Deployment):** Learn **Streamlit**. It allows you to build a web UI for your Python scripts in minutes (perfect for showcasing projects).\n",
      "-   **Project 3 (GenAI):** Learn to use APIs (like OpenAI API or HuggingFace) to integrate Large Language Models into your code.\n",
